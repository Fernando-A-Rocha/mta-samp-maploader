> [!CAUTION]
> This project has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. The code is provided as-is and may not work as expected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I recommend using my other project "MTA Map Loader", which supports all map formats and is more stable (**coming soon**).

**mta-samp-maploader** is a MTA resource that reads SA-MP map code in Pawn and loads the map objects and other elements in MTA.
