# How to generate a .col from a .dff model

1. [Download KDFF GUI](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6zt7imr1j66aer7/kdffgui.zip/file)
2. Launch kdffgui.exe
3. Import the dff file using the dff button
4. Leave `Optimize` box checked
5. Choose one of the following options:
    1. Empty: no collision
    2. Box: simple box collision (very optimized)
    3. Mesh Faces: matches all polygons
6. Press `Make Col` to generate your .col file

PS: Don't overwrite existing .dff to have it integrate your new collision (this is only for SA-MP)
